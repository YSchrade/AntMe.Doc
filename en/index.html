    <p>Before you can take command of your colony, you need to install AntMe! on your computer. That means you need to install the game itself as well as a few extra bits that help it run (what programmers call &#34;dependencies&#34;). So you will also need to download and install a development environment, which is what you will use to write and edit the code itself. And you will need a couple of frameworks, which are sort of like building blocks that programmers use.</p>

    <p>Once you have gotten acquainted with the game you can start programming your ants. The tutorial lessons are a great place to begin.</p>
